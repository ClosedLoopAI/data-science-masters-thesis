    "This project suggests an automatic way for post-flight analysts to undertake classification of flight profiles into useful versus non-useful classes. Instead of using the traditional algorithms for time-series classification, this work makes use of a relatively new approach: Before classifying, first transform a time-series into an image. This allows for the application of a well-developed set of algorithms from the area of computer vision. In this project, we perform a comparison of a number of these transformation techniques in terms of their associated image classification performance. We apply each transformation technique to the time-series dataset in turn, train a Convolutional Neural Network to do classification, and record the performance. Then we select the most performant transformation technique (a simple line plot that got a 100% F1-score) and use it in the rest of the analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of three models. The first model classifies flight profiles into developed (useful) and non-developed (non-useful) profiles. The second model performs multi-label classification on the developed profiles from the first model. The labels reflect whether a profile has canonical climb/cruise/descent segments. The last model classifies flight profiles with canonical cruise segments into classes that have extended cruises (useful) and shorter cruises (non-useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we prepare a significant unlabeled test dataset, consisting of data points that have never been seen by any of the models. We construct an end-to-end analytic inference process to simulate a production system, apply it to the test dataset, and obtain impressive results. Finally, we make recommendations to post-flight and other interested analysts.\n",

    "One of the important operational characteristics of a commercial airliner is its flight path. This term needs qualification though. The *lateral* flight path is the track projected onto a flat earth from above. To visualize the lateral flight path one can plot longitude versus latitude as flight time progresses. The *vertical* flight path, on the other hand, is the altitude profile (viewed from the side). This may be visualized by plotting altitude versus flight time. This project will focus on the vertical flight path. When we use the term flight path or flight profile in the rest of the document, we will always refer to the *vertical* flight path."

    "During normal operation, an airliner has a predictable flight path. After *takeoff*, it climbs as quickly as possible (during the phase known as *climb*) until it reaches a point called the *top of climb*. The pilot then levels off and usually maintains this altitude for most of the flight (straight-and-level flight). This phase of the flight is known as *cruise*. When nearing its destination, a point is reached that is known as *top of descent*. At this point the pilot enters the *descent* phase. Finally, the flight ends during the *landing* of the aircraft."

    "Post-flight data analysts are often interested in separating useful from non-useful (or less useful) flight paths prior to a specific analysis. In this document, and its associated analysis code, useful profiles will be labeled as *typical* (abbreviated as “typ”) while less useful, non-useful, or anomalous flight paths (for a specific analysis) will be labeled as *non-typical* (abbreviated as “non”). A *typical* flight profile, in the context of this document, has a relatively extended cruise section without changes in altitude (see Figure 1.1). This characteristic will make it useful for certain types of analyses, for example, to estimate hard-to-measure variables like drag and exact angle-of-attack, as well as estimations of the positions of vertical flight control surfaces (even though they are measured). Flight paths could also be considered *non-typical* due to insignificant (i.e. too short) cruise segments and missing data (see Figure 1.2). Note that our definition of usefulness is by no means universal in post-flight analysis."
