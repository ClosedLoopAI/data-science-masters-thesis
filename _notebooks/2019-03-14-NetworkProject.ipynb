The symbolic vertex names (airport codes) are not shown to improve clarity. There are 755 vertices and 23,473 edges (although this is not apparent from the visualization). It is quite clear that, as we might expect, that this is a *scale-free* (rather than a random) network. A number of prominent, highly connected vertices are easy to spot.  Another characteristic of this network is its apparent partitioning of vertices into a number of cohesive subgroups. There seems to be two main subgroups and several smaller ones. There are even small “islands” of a few connected vertices. The visualization reveals the presence of some *self-loops* in the network."
